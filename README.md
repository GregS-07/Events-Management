### How to run
In order to run the project, run this command in terminal to download PySimpleGui:
```bash
pip install PySimpleGUI
```
As long as python is installed correctly, all that's left is to doubleclick main.py
### How it works
There are different tabs with their own tables in the database. Staff, students and events must be added into their table in order to assign people to an event. Buttons work exactly as labelled. All tables are stored in database.db and all code is in main.py

### Purpose
A software to assign and track people/department hours in College events was discussed in a meeting and then the IT students were asked to create a sort of prototype and for it to be submitted.
